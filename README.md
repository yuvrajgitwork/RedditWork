This project uses a Google Colab notebook to generate structured personas from any public Reddit profile. It uses a pre-trained LLM like Falcon (or Mistral) to analyze Reddit comments and posts, and outputs a UX-style persona in `.txt` format â€” with citations.

##  Features

-  Built in a single, ready-to-run Colab notebook
- Scrapes Reddit user posts + comments via PRAW
-  Feeds that data to Falcon/Mistral for persona generation
-  Cites each trait with exact Reddit comments/posts
-  Outputs a clean persona text file downloadable in Colab

---

## Quick Start

[ Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/projectparse/blob/main/RedditPersonaGenerator.ipynb)

### 1. Setup Reddit API keys

Go to: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps  
Create a script-type app. Then fill in the notebook like:

```python
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
REDDIT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"
REDDIT_USER_AGENT = "projectparse"
2. Hugging Face Token (Optional)
If you're using Mistral, Zephyr, or other gated models:


from huggingface_hub import login
login("your_HF_access_token")
How It Works
Enter a Reddit profile URL like:


https://www.reddit.com/user/Hungry-Move-6603/
The notebook will:

Extract the username

Scrape up to 100 comments/posts

Format the data

Generate a structured persona with citations

Save it as a .txt file

You can download the output with:


from google.colab import files
files.download("Hungry-Move-6603_persona.txt")

## Since the .txt file is just plain text, using PIL libraries I've converted it to be UX friendly like given in the prompt (Lucas).
